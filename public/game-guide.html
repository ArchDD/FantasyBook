                            To keep track of the books and characters you create, you should first create an account and login, which can be done by clicking on the 'Login/Register' button in the top-right hand corner.

                            Clicking on the 'Character' button in the navigation bar above will take you to the Character screen, where you can name and customize your character.

                            Your character is placed inside the books you join, and your choices determine how it will act as well as how the story unfolds.

                            Books can be created and accessed via the 'Books' button in the navigation bar above. If you have not created any books, the bookshelf will have a single, ghost book. 

                            The ghost book is used for adding new books to your shelf. Clicking on it will take you to the book creation form, where you can specify what kind of book you want to create and who you want to invite to play in it.

                            Every book's story progresses through the creation and completion of events. Completing an event by making a choice fills in the page with the results of the choice, and unlocks the next event on the following page. 

                            Each book's chosen theme determines the style of events that appear. Whether the book is fantasy with mythical creatures and races,
                            or science fiction with spaceships and star systems, depends entirely on the category chosen when creating the book.
